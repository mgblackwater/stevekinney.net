The material in this course is intended to go along with the [Introduction to Testing](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/intro-testing/) course with [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com).

Testing increases your confidence that your applications will function as expected. This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of testing and give you the foundations to write more testable code in your applications. You’ll set up an efficient testing environment where a test runner is part of your development workflow. You’ll gain practical experience writing unit and integration tests while exploring common testing tools.

## Prerequisites

- A fundamental understanding JavaScript
- Familiarity with the command line
- Experience with Node and npm

## Additional Reading

In this course, we're going try to have a bias towards being hands-on and only delve into the philosophical bits when absolutely necessary. I'd prefer we spend our time writing tests rather than talking about writing tests. That said, I do have a bunch of materials on the thinking around best practices in terms of testing and you're more than welcome to go through them at your leisure.

- [The Structure of a Unit Test](/courses/testing/structure-of-a-unit-test)
- [The Types of Tests: Unit, Integration, End-to-End](/courses/testing/types-of-tests)
- [Components of a Test: Test Runners and Assertion Libraries](/courses/testing/test-runners-and-assertion-libraries)
- [Assert Versus Expect](/courses/testing/assert-versus-expect)

## Libraries and Tools Used

Throughout this course, we'll be leveraging the following libraries.

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

Even if you use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), _almost_ all of the content in this course applies. If you're curious, you can read more in [The Differences Between Jest and Vitest](/courses/testing/differences-between-jest-and-vitest).

Additionally, I also have some further reading on some more advanced topics that are beyond the scope of this course.

- [Advanced Vitest Configuration](/courses/testing/advanced-test-configuration)
- [Advanced Debugging in Vitest](/courses/testing/debugging-vitest-tests)
- [Creating Custom Reporters in Vitest](/courses/testing/vitest-reporters)
- [Creating Custom Matchers in Vitest](/courses/testing/custom-matchers)
- [Parallel and Serial Test Execution](/courses/testing/parallel-and-serial-test-execution)
- [Test Contexts in Vitest](/courses/testing/test-context)
- [Running Tests for Related Files in Vitest](/courses/testing/running-tests-for-related-files)
