**Objective**: Apply all learned concepts in a real-world scenario.

- Build a small ticket booking system for a Green Day concert using Vitest for testing.
- Test cases should involve:

  - Spying on callback functions.
  - Mocking external services like payment processors.
  - Testing asynchronous flows like email notifications and payment confirmation.
