## The Magic of Test Suites

So, you're hip-deep in writing tests, and suddenly you realize: “Hey, I’m just throwing tests everywhere! This is chaos!" Fear not! *Test suites* are here to save us from descending into an abyss of spaghetti code hell.

In Vitest, a **test suite** is a nice little wrapper where we can group related tests together. Think of them as a box where you can organize your tests by functionality, helping to keep things tidy. A well-organized test suite means future-you (and your teammates) won’t hate current-you for writing a mess.

Here's what it looks like:

```javascript
describe('Math utilities', () => {
	it('should correctly add two numbers', () => {
		expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
	});

	it('should correctly subtract two numbers', () => {
		expect(subtract(5, 3)).toBe(2);
	});
});
```

Nice and clean, right? You use `describe` to create a suite, and `it` to write each individual test. You can also use `test` instead of `it` if you want. They’re pretty much the same thing—it’s like aliases for your database tables, but way more exciting.

## Nested Describes (a.k.a. Going Deeper)

Now, let’s say you have a monstrous utility file with all kinds of math-y goodness—addition, subtraction, division, etc. You can actually **nest** your test suites to organize them even further!

```javascript
describe('Math utilities', () => {
	describe('Addition', () => {
		it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
			expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
		});

		it('should correctly add two negative numbers', () => {
			expect(add(-1, -2)).toBe(-3);
		});
	});

	describe('Subtraction', () => {
		it('should correctly subtract two numbers', () => {
			expect(subtract(5, 3)).toBe(2);
		});
	});
});
```

Ah, beautiful. Like a carefully constructed filing cabinet for your sanity. With the nested `describe`, you're slicing and dicing your tests like a coding ninja.

## Writing Test Files Like a Pro

Great! Now we’re organizing *within* a file, but what about the files themselves? Here’s a standard structure I like to recommend:

```ts
src/
  utils/
    math.js
  __tests__/
    math.test.js
```

- **`math.js`** holds your utilities.
- **`math.test.js`** holds your tests.

By convention, we use an `__tests__` folder to dump, well, tests! This naming keeps them out of production builds, flags them easily for test tooling, and just generally looks like a developer who’s got their life together.

## Grouping Tests by Feature or Behavior

Now, for some **real-world** talk: grouping tests can get subjective. If you've got a small project, you can get away with organizing by feature (e.g., grouping tests related to the "Cart" in your e-commerce app):

```ts
src/
  cart.js
__tests__/
  cart.test.js
```

As your app grows—like, we're talking "giant JavaScript monolith that haunts your dreams" level—you might start breaking things down even further, such as by controller, utility functions, or API endpoints.

For instance:

```ts
src/
  api/
    userController.js
  utils/
    cart.js
__tests__/
  api/
    userController.test.js
  utils/
    cart.test.js
```

## Don’t Overcomplicate the Structure

Here’s the thing: test organization will naturally grow with your codebase. You don’t need to start with a full-on meticulous architecture unless you’ve got a crystal ball predicting the future scale of your app (hint: you don’t).

Here’s my advice—start simple:

1. Group tests within a file using `describe`.
2. Split into different folders when things get unruly.
3. Remember, clear and simple is better than “fancy” folder structures that confuse future-you.

More often than not, you’ll regret overengineering test organization because you’ll spend more time searching for the tests than actually writing them.

## Conclusion

Test suites and organized test files aren’t just for your peace of mind—they're also going to help when you need to scale and refactor your project down the line. Imagine hopping back into these files six months later and being able to *easily* find the tests! Glorious.

So go forth and `describe` yourself some sanity.
