[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) is designed to help you out with writing tests that focus on user behavior rather than implementation details. It provides utilities to query and interact with the DOM in a way that's similar to how users would.

## Why Use Testing Library?

- **User-Centric Testing**: Focuses on testing components from the user's perspective.
- **Avoids Implementation Details**: Reduces coupling between tests and component internals.
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Leads to tests that are more robust and less prone to breakage due to refactoring.
- **Accessible Queries**: Encourages testing with queries that reflect accessibility best practices.

In your `vitest.config.js` file, set the `test` environment to `'jsdom'` (or `happy-dom`). Just like we did in [Testing the DOM](testing-the-dom.md).

```javascript
// vitest.config.js
export default {
	test: {
		environment: 'jsdom',
	},
};
```

## Writing Tests with Testing Library

Okay, let's imagine that we have this very, very simple component.

```jsx
// Greeting.js
import React from 'react';

export function Greeting({ name }) {
	return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

The tests might look something like this.

```jsx
// Greeting.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { Greeting } from './Greeting';

test('renders greeting message', () => {
	const name = 'Alice';

	render(<Greeting name={name} />);

	expect(screen.getByText(`Hello, ${name}!`)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Best Practices with Testing Library

### Querying Elements the Right Way

Testing Library provides various queries:

- **Preferred Queries**: `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByPlaceholderText`, `getByText`, etc.
- **Less Preferred**: `getByTestId`

So, for this `<Button />` component:

```jsx
// Button.js
export function Button({ onClick, children }) {
	return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
}
```

You'd maybe have a test that looks something like this:

```jsx
test('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
	const handleClick = vi.fn();
	render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>);

	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i });
	button.click();

	expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

Using `getByRole('button')` is preferred as it reflects how users (including those using assistive technologies) interact with the application.

### Avoid Testing Implementation Details

Focus on what the component renders, not how it renders it. So, you'd want to **avoid** doing something like this:

```jsx
const { container } = render(<Component />);
const div = container.querySelector('.my-class');
```

Instead, you'd **prefer** to do something like this:

```jsx
const element = screen.getByText(/some text/i);
```

### Use `userEvent` for Simulating User Interactions

`userEvent` simulates real user interactions more accurately than `fireEvent`.

**Example:**

```jsx
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

test('checkbox toggles correctly', async () => {
	render(<CheckboxComponent />);
	const checkbox = screen.getByRole('checkbox');

	await userEvent.click(checkbox);
	expect(checkbox).toBeChecked();
});
```

### Async-Await with Asynchronous Updates

When testing components that update asynchronously, use `findBy` queries and `waitFor`.

**Example:**

```jsx
test('loads and displays data', async () => {
	render(<AsyncComponent />);
	expect(screen.getByText(/loading/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

	const dataElement = await screen.findByText(/loaded data/i);
	expect(dataElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Clean Up After Tests

Testing Library automatically cleans up the DOM after each test, but if you have additional cleanup, handle it in `afterEach`.

### Use `jest-dom` Matchers

Enhance your assertions with matchers like `toBeInTheDocument`, `toBeVisible`, etc.

```jsx
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

expect(element).toBeVisible();
```

## When is Testing Library Beneficial?

### Testing User Interactions

- **Benefit**: Ensures that components behave correctly when users interact with them.
- **Example**: Testing form submissions, button clicks, input changes.

### Ensuring Accessibility

- **Benefit**: Encourages the use of accessible selectors (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`).
- **Example**: Verifying that all interactive elements are accessible via screen readers.

### Component Behavior Testing

- **Benefit**: Validates that components render the correct output based on props and state.
- **Example**: Testing conditional rendering, list outputs, error messages.

### Avoiding Fragile Tests

- **Benefit**: Tests are less likely to break due to changes in implementation details (like class names or DOM structure).
- **Example**: Refactoring a component without changing its external behavior won't break the tests.

## Potential Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Over-Reliance on `getByTestId`

**Issue**: Using `data-testid` attributes can lead to tests that are more coupled to implementation details.

**Solution**:

- Prefer queries that reflect how users interact with the UI.
- Use `getByTestId` only when no other query is suitable.

### Ignoring Accessibility Considerations

**Issue**: Not using accessible queries can miss out on testing the component's accessibility.

**Solution**:

- Use queries like `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, which encourage accessible coding practices.

### Not Waiting for Asynchronous Updates

**Issue**: Tests may pass or fail inconsistently if they don't account for asynchronous state updates.

**Solution**:

- Use `findBy` queries or `waitFor` to wait for asynchronous changes.

### Testing Implementation Details

**Issue**: Querying specific DOM nodes or component internals can make tests fragile.

**Solution**:

- Focus on the component's output and user interactions.
- Avoid reaching into component internals or relying on specific HTML structures.

### Mocking Too Much

**Issue**: Over-mocking components and modules can lead to tests that don't reflect actual behavior.

**Solution**:

- Mock external dependencies like network requests.
- Avoid mocking components unless necessary.

## Examples in Practice

### Testing Form Submission

```jsx
// LoginForm.js
export function LoginForm({ onSubmit }) {
	return (
		<form
			onSubmit={(e) => {
				e.preventDefault();
				const { username, password } = e.target.elements;
				onSubmit({
					username: username.value,
					password: password.value,
				});
			}}
		>
			<label>
				Username:
				<input name="username" />
			</label>
			<label>
				Password:
				<input name="password" type="password" />
			</label>
			<button type="submit">Login</button>
		</form>
	);
}
```

**Test:**

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { expect, test, vi } from 'vitest';
import { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';

test('submits the form with username and password', async () => {
	const handleSubmit = vi.fn();
	render(<LoginForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);

	await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/username/i), 'myUser');
	await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), 'myPass');
	await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /login/i }));

	expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
		username: 'myUser',
		password: 'myPass',
	});
});
```

**Explanation:**

- Simulates user typing into inputs and clicking the submit button.
- Verifies that `onSubmit` is called with the correct data.

### Testing Component with Asynchronous Data

```jsx
// DataLoader.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function DataLoader() {
	const [data, setData] = useState(null);

	useEffect(() => {
		fetch('/api/data')
			.then((res) => res.json())
			.then(setData);
	}, []);

	if (!data) return <div>Loadingâ€¦</div>;
	return <div>Data: {data.value}</div>;
}
```

**Test:**

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, test, vi } from 'vitest';
import { DataLoader } from './DataLoader';

test('loads and displays data', async () => {
	global.fetch = vi.fn(() =>
		Promise.resolve({
			json: () => Promise.resolve({ value: 'Test Data' }),
		}),
	);

	render(<DataLoader />);
	expect(screen.getByText(/loading/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

	const dataElement = await screen.findByText(/data: test data/i);
	expect(dataElement).toBeInTheDocument();

	global.fetch.mockRestore();
});
```

**Explanation:**

- Mocks `fetch` to return test data.
- Uses `findByText` to wait for the asynchronous update.
