Alright, let’s talk **toBeFalsy()**. This one’s like that friend who’s skeptical of everything—they’re not easily convinced. When you use `toBeFalsy()`, you're basically saying, “I want this thing to be one of the JavaScript values that’s considered falsey.”

Now, what does that mean? In JavaScript, “falsy” values include:

- `false`
- `0`
- `""` (empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN` (Not a Number)

Basically, anything that doesn't stand up in a conditional context like `if (value)` is considered falsy. So, if you're expecting an outcome that's one of these, `toBeFalsy()` is your move.

## When You’d Use It

Use `toBeFalsy()` when you don’t care exactly _what_ falsy value something is, but you just want to check if it is, in fact, **not truthy**. For example, does a function return `undefined` when it fails? Or maybe it returns an empty string? `toBeFalsy()` is your broad-strokes check for situations where any falsy value will satisfy the condition.

## Example

Let’s imagine we’re building a music library (shoutout to Green Day fans). If there's a function that's trying to check if the artist exists in the library but returns something falsy when the artist is missing or doesn't exist, we can use `toBeFalsy()` to verify that.

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

function findArtist(artists, name) {
	return artists.find((artist) => artist.name === name) || undefined;
}

describe('findArtist', () => {
	const artists = [{ name: 'Green Day' }, { name: 'Nirvana' }];

	it('should return undefined if the artist is not found', () => {
		const result = findArtist(artists, 'The Beatles');

		// We expect `result` to be undefined, which is falsy in JavaScript
		expect(result).toBeFalsy();
	});
});
```

Here, `findArtist` returns `undefined` if an artist isn't in our list. We're testing to make sure any falsy value comes back when it can’t find the artist, and `toBeFalsy()` is doing the hard work of deciding which falsy value it is (spoiler alert: it’s `undefined`).

## Why Use It

Sometimes you don’t care _which_ falsy thing it is, you just care that it **ain’t true**. That’s when `toBeFalsy()` shines—it’s kinda like taking the test with a pencil that has a huge eraser. You’re ready for just about anything the JavaScript universe can throw at you that evaluates to false.
