Ah, `expect.assertions`â€”a handy little tool that can save you from pulling your hair out when your test decides to skip an assertion like, "Peace outâ€”Iâ€™m not running today." So what does this do exactly?

`expect.assertions(number)` tells Vitest, "**Yo, Vitest!** I expect exactly `number` assertions to be called during this test." It comes in super useful when youâ€™re dealing with asynchronous codeâ€”especially when you want to double-check that **all** your assertions actually ran.

Without this, you might write a test that *looks* like it works but sneaks out the back door before the important stuff actually happens. Cue weeks of confusion as you try to figure out why something wasnâ€™t properly tested ðŸ˜¡.

## When Would You Use It?

Good question. The most common scenario where `expect.assertions` becomes your BFF is when youâ€™re testing **async code** like promises, API calls, or pretty much anything where the test has to wait for something to happen. If your test finishes before those assertions run (uh-oh), Vitest will happily tell you, "Yup, Iâ€™m all done," without realizing that your assertions weren't called.

In those "fun" moments, `expect.assertions` steps in to make sure all expected assertions are eventually reached, safeguarding you from code quietly ignoring your tests.

## Example Time: Async Testing With `expect.assertions`

Letâ€™s say weâ€™ve got a music library app (how convenient!) and weâ€™re testing a function that fetches an albumâ€™s details:

Hereâ€™s our function `getAlbum`:

```js
async function getAlbum(albumId) {
	if (!albumId) {
		throw new Error('Album ID is required');
	}

	// Simulate an async request to get album details
	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		setTimeout(() => {
			resolve({
				artist: 'Green Day',
				album: 'Dookie',
				year: 1994,
			});
		}, 100);
	});
}
```

Now, we want to write a test to make sure this function behaves when:

1. It throws an error if no `albumId` is provided.
2. It resolves with album details when the `albumId` is valid.

```js
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { getAlbum } from './musicLibrary';

test('getAlbum throws an error with no albumId', async () => {
	expect.assertions(1);

	try {
		await getAlbum();
	} catch (e) {
		expect(e.message).toBe('Album ID is required');
	}
});

test('getAlbum returns correct album details', async () => {
	expect.assertions(1);

	const details = await getAlbum(1);

	expect(details).toEqual({
		artist: 'Green Day',
		album: 'Dookie',
		year: 1994,
	});
});
```

### Breakdown

In both tests, `expect.assertions(1)` is basically saying, "Hey! I fully expect one assertion to be called in this testâ€”nothing more, nothing less." This way, if something goes sideways (like your try-catch not catching an error, or your async function completing before the assertion), Vitest throws a red flag, and you avoid those mysterious silent failures.

And thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve now got a handy tool in your testing toolbox to make sure your **assertions don't ghost you mid-test**. ðŸ˜‰

Honestly, if youâ€™ve ever lost precious debugging time only to realize your test wasnâ€™t making it to that crucial `expect` statement, this method will feel like a mini superhero strapped right into your test suite.
