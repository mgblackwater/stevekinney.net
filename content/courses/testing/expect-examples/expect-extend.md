# expect.extend

Alright, let's talk about something _pretty neat_ in Vitest: `expect.extend`. This is like giving yourself superpowers when it comes to assertions. Most folks are used to using the built-in matchers like `toBe`, `toEqual`, and `toHaveBeenCalledWith`â€”and, believe me, those are fantastic! But sometimes you want an assertion method thatâ€™s a little more _specific_ to your domain, like, I don't know, checking if a band has released at least one multi-platinum album, and `toBe` just isn't going to cut it. Thatâ€™s where `expect.extend` shines. It lets you write **custom matchers** tailored to your specific problem space.

### When would you use it?

Youâ€™d use `expect.extend` when you find yourself writing the same custom assertion logic in multiple test cases, or when the built-in matchers donâ€™t quite express what youâ€™re trying to test. It's about making your life easier when you're asserting things that are unique to your app (or music library, _wink_).

For instance, letâ€™s say you've got this hypothetical music library app we keep talking about. You might want a matcher like `toBeLegendaryArtist`, which passes if an artist (like Green Day) has released more than 5 albums. Sure, you could write that test logic inline for each `expect`, but why not define it _once_ and make your test assertions way more readable?

### How does it work?

You pass an object to `expect.extend` where each property is the name of a custom matcher you want to defineâ€”along with the function that defines how it works.

Here's an example where we build a custom matcher to check if an artist has released more than 5 albums.

### Example

```javascript
// Let's extend Vitest with a custom matcher
expect.extend({
  toBeLegendaryArtist(received) {
    const pass = received.albums.length > 5;
    if (pass) {
      return {
        message: () =>
          `Expected ${received.name} to not be a legendary artist ðŸ˜±`,
        pass: true,
      };
    }
    return {
      message: () => `Expected ${received.name} to be a legendary artist ðŸ¤¨`,
      pass: false,
    };
  },
});

// Example artist data
const greenDay = {
  name: 'Green Day',
  albums: [
    'Dookie',
    'Insomniac',
    'Nimrod',
    'Warning',
    'American Idiot',
    '21st Century Breakdown',
  ],
};

const nickleback = {
  name: 'Nickleback',
  albums: ['Silver Side Up', 'The Long Road', 'All the Right Reasons'],
};

// Example test using the custom matcher
test('checks if Green Day is a legendary artist', () => {
  expect(greenDay).toBeLegendaryArtist();
});

test('checks if Nickleback is a legendary artist', () => {
  expect(nickleback).not.toBeLegendaryArtist();
});
```

### Whatâ€™s happening here?

We created a custom matcher, `toBeLegendaryArtist`. The function inside checks whether the artist has more than 5 albums. If they do, great, youâ€™re a legendary artist. If notâ€¦ well, sorry.

Now, instead of needing to write `expect(artist.albums.length).toBeGreaterThan(5)` every time, you can just say `expect(artist).toBeLegendaryArtist()` or its `not` formâ€”_and_ you get a nice, customized error message.

### When to use custom matchers?

When you find yourself writing the same messy, domain-specific logic across multiple test files, a custom matcher is a great way to clean that up. Think of them like helper functions but for your `expect` statements. And let's be real, anything that makes tests more readable is a win in my book.
