## toHaveBeenCalledTimes in Vitest

Alright, here's the deal: `toHaveBeenCalledTimes` is a matcher in Vitest that, as the name suggests, checks how many times a **mock function** (or spy, or jest-like "hey, what's _this_ thing doing?") has been called during a test. It's super useful when you want to test whether certain functions, like event handlers or API calls, are being executed the correct number of times.

### Why Would You Use It?

Youâ€™d grab this matcher when you're dealing with functions you think are being called more times (or fewer times) than they should. Maybe you set up a `click` event listener and expect it to get hit exactly once, but the button's getting mashed, and it's triggering itâ€¦ **seven times**. ðŸ¤¦

This matcher helps you **assert** whether a mock function was called the right number of times, like a bouncer counting how many people came to the partyâ€”but instead of a party, it's just stressed out developers and broken promises.

**When would I use it?**

- Verifying API calls or function invocations after a specific user action.
- Ensuring that side effects like network requests or console logs are happening the expected number of times.

### Example

Letâ€™s stick with our ongoing "Mid-2000s Punk Rock Music Library Application." Imagine youâ€™ve got a `fetchAlbums` function that pulls Green Day's discography when a user clicks a button.

```js
const fetchAlbums = jest.fn();

function displayAlbums(artist) {
	if (artist === 'Green Day') {
		fetchAlbums();
	}
}
```

Now, letâ€™s write the test for that:

```js
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('displayAlbums function', () => {
	it('should call fetchAlbums once when artist is Green Day', () => {
		const fetchAlbums = vi.fn();

		// We hit â€˜em with the Green Day and make sure the albums are fetched!
		displayAlbums('Green Day');

		expect(fetchAlbums).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
	});
});
```

#### Key Takeaways:

- We expect `fetchAlbums` to be called **exactly once**. If it was called zero times or two times, the test would fail.
- If you swap `'Green Day'` with another band like (dare we say) _Coldplay_, and the function doesn't call `fetchAlbums()`, we can infer our logic is nice and conditional.

### Real-World Scenarios:

- **Button click**: Ensuring a user's interaction (like clicking a button) fires the handler only once.
- **API calls**: Making sure weâ€™re not accidentally hitting endpoints multiple times with redundant information. Or worseâ€”missing a call!

Thatâ€™s it! Calm the chaos in your functions. `toHaveBeenCalledTimes` is like traffic control for your functions, making sure they behave themselves.
