We want to create a new `Post` object. The arguments that it should take are a `title` and a `description`. But, the function itself will add one of those [random IDs that we created earlier](asymmetric-matchers-exercise.md).

We want to make sure that we're getting back a similar item to what we're passing in, but it should have an `id` field.

```ts
```
